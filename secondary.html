        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
        Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
        development can range from developing a simple single static page of
        plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and
        social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
        development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design,
        Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
        scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
        development.
